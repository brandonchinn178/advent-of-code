# Advent of Code

My solutions to the advent of code puzzles

## 2017

See `2017/README.md`

## 2018

`cd` into the `2018` directory and run `stack runhaskell <file>`. If it
complains about missing packages, run `stack build` with the corresponding
packages (they should be fairly standard libraries).
