# Advent of Code

My solutions to the advent of code puzzles

## 2017

See `2017/README.md`

## 2018

`cd` into the `2018` directory and run `stack runhaskell <file>`. If it
complains about missing packages, run `stack build` with the corresponding
packages (they should be fairly standard libraries).

## 2019

`cd` into the `2019` directory and run `stack runghc <file>`. If it complains
about missing packages, run `stack build` with the corresponding packages (they
should be fairly standard libraries).

## 2021

`cd` into the `2021` directory and run `stack <file>`.

## 2022

`cd` into the `2022` directory and run `make DAY=DayX`.

To run with the sample input, run `make sample DAY=DayX`.
